---------------------------------------

Adds inspect and debug mode directly in the browsers

## Features

- Inspect mode `(Ctrl+Alt+I)`
- Debug mode `(Ctrl+Alt+D)`
- Supports the [Web Essentials Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-essentials/mghdcdlpcdiodelbplncnodiiadljhhk)

### Inspect Mode
This mode will put the browser in a state where hovering the various DOM elements in the Browser will open the corresponding file in Visual Studio and select the range that produced the DOM element.

### Debug Mode
Does the same as Inspect Mode as well as put the document in edit mode. It is then possible to make text changes directly in the browser and see the changes persisted back into the source file in Visual Studio in real time.
